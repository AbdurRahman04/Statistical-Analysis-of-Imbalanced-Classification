Statistical Analysis of Imbalanced Classification with Training Size Variation and Subsampling on Datasets of Research Papers in Biomedical Literature 
This study addresses the challenge of imbalanced classification in machine learning, particularly in biomedical research, where datasets often have underrepresented classes. Such imbalances can lead to biased models that perform well for majority classes but poorly for minority classes, which are often of greater research interest. The research investigates the impact of subsampling techniques and training size variations on classification performance, aiming to establish best practices for handling imbalanced datasets in biomedical text classification. Prior studies highlight the importance of preprocessing, sampling strategies, and algorithm selection in improving model accuracy. Researchers like Goudjil et al. (2018) and Mali et al. (2021) demonstrate how preprocessing steps and active learning approaches enhance classification outcomes. Additionally, statistical methods such as ANOVA and t-tests are emphasized for evaluating model performance. This study builds on these insights to develop reliable methods for managing imbalanced datasets, ensuring equitable and accurate classification in biomedical applications.
